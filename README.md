# Bevy Game Bits

Welcome!

This repository contains my experiments with the Bevy Engine. My goal is to learn the engine by building simple games after building precise game mechanics.

## Running examples

You'll need to install Rust. The default toolchain should work.

You can then run any example with this command:
```sh
cargo run --example 004-infinite-runner
```

## Track

I try to follow this path, allowing myself to work on secondary topics from time to time.

First column below lists topics that are essential for the next milestone marked by a `+` (plus) sign.
The second one contains random topics that I simply wanted to work on after a shower thought!

```
